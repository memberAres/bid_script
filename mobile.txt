Dear sir.
I am a full-stack web developer who have a soft spot for progressive javascript framework & library.
Simple Integration by contributing component, light weight and good flexibility - these are the reasons I like React/Angular/Vue.js.
With React or vue, I can make a very solid structure with clear cycling workflow (components => actions => mutation => state => components => ...)
Two way binding and use of directives are the reasons I like AngularJS.
With ngrx, I can implement solid state management structure (state -> UI -> action -> reducer -> store -> state)
I have also rich experience in mobile app development using native/hybrid mobile app development using Swift/Android Studio/Ionic/React/Xamarin, etc.
As a senior programmer, I proudly guarantee best code quality.
As a web/mobile developer focused on customer satisfaction, I manage all aspects of web development from concept to requirements definition, design, development, launch, maintenance and user support. I enjoy the client-facing role and working closely with team members to produce high-quality deliverables.
Looking forward to working with you.
Sincerely.
