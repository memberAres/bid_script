Hi, 
My favorite thing is sitting down with you one on one about what keeps you awake at night.
What is really bugging you? Let's solve it together. Maybe we'll cut costs, maybe we'll improve revenue, or maybe we will do both (yay!).

As an autodidact, I pride myself on learning new technologies and continually improving my skill-set. As a freelancer, I believe in professionalism, communication, clean code and representing my craft to the highest degree possible.

I provide creative, high-tech solutions to your web design and programming needs. I adhere to industry best practices and bring to your projects the disciplines of MVC framework design patterns, git version control and project management systems such as Jira, Trello and Asana. I can either work alone or in collaboration with your existing development team. My projects have been as lead developer or team member alike with great success.

Thanks a million.
